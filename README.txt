Milestone 1: Introduction to socket programming

* Echoclient and Echoserver

- Overview

The objective of this assignment is to implement a simple
client program that is able to establish a TCP connection
to a given server and exchange text messages with it.
The client should provide a command line-based interface
that captures the user’s input and controls the interaction
with the server.
Besides connection establishment and tear down, the user
must be able to pass messages to the server.
These messages are in turn echoed back to the client where
they are displayed to the user.
